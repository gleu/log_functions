log_functions is a PostgreSQL module that logs each function executed.

Many things can be logged:
* the DECLARE statement,
* the BEGIN statement,
* the END statement,
* and the start and end of each statement in the BEGIN/END block of a function.

There are five optional parameters that allow you to select which logs you want:

* log_functions.log_declare
* log_functions.log_function_begin
* log_functions.log_function_end
* log_functions.log_statement_begin
* log_functions.log_statement_end

See the INSTALL file for installation and usage informations.
